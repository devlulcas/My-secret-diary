<h1 align="center">ðŸ“–MY SECRET DIARYðŸ“–</h1>
<h2>ðŸ”’ Objective</h2>
The idea here is to make an online diary. For now is just the front-end.
<h2>ðŸ˜° Problems</h2>
As I'm just starting out on the web I don't know much yet, so its being very difficult to know what I need to do on such a big a project (for me its very big). So.. for now I'll just study a little more and come back later, when I feel more confortable with the web itself
